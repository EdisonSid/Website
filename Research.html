    <p><b><i><h1>Modernology</h1></i> </p> 
        <p><h3 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
         My research is centered around the concept of modernology, which involves examining the traces of time and the 
         remnants of past events in our contemporary environment. This exploration is not limited to a specific medium; 
         rather, it encompasses a wide range of artistic practices, including painting, photography, and the use of found objects.
         I am particularly interested in how these traces manifest in urban landscapes and how they can be interpreted 
         through various artistic lenses. 
         <br>My methodology is characterized by an interdisciplinary approach that combines elements of art, anthropology, and archaeology.
        This approach encompasses field research, urban exploration, uncovering historical traces in the landscape,
         and gathering oral histories through interviews and informal conversationsâ€”all of which are integral 
         to my creative process.<br/></h3></p>
